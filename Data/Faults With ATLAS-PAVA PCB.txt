Faults with ATLAS/PAVA

1/ HX1TXD Pin fouls ICSP header			- Just deal with it and fix in R2
2/ Holes for Samtec headers too large	- Just deal with it and fix in R2
3/ Polygon Priority mistake has left VBATT connected directly to GND. - Fix with scalpel and fix in R2

To Fix :

1/ GPS getting time but then freezes before getting a lock. Not power saving related. 

Replicate known working setup :
a) Hardwire on.
b) Disconnect battery line.

2/ When HX1 board powers up get a short across PSU.

Since GPS module and Radio were fitted.
