Faults with ATLAS/PAVA

1/ HX1TXD Pin fouls ICSP header			- Just deal with it and fix in R2
2/ Holes for Samtec headers too large	- Just deal with it and fix in R2
3/ Polygon Priority mistake has left VBATT connected directly to GND. - Fix with scalpel and fix in R2
4/ µC Board was done on 1.6mm PCB - Just deal with it and fix in R2 

To Fix :

1/ GPS getting time but then freezes before getting a lock. Not power saving related. 

Code related. When using RF22 library GPS locks up, using RFM22 library it seems to work. Fixed by using RFM22 library but unsure as to cause.

2/ When HX1 board powers up board resets/power sags. 

Since GPS module and Radio were fitted ?
5V enable is ok.
Problem occurs on bringing HX1EN high.
